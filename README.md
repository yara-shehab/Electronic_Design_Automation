Phase 1:
Introduction:
In this phase of the project, I was implementing a digital access control
which has a correct entry code “26A05”. It operates in two modes:
Daytime (in the morning) that can opens if the user press only “O” or one
or more right digits then “O” for example “26” then “O”.
Although at the night the door only opens if the code is correct otherwise
the alarm is triggered in case of any incorrect digit.
